Front-end Audit
===============

A document used as a basis for outlining and planning your front-end build.

Template
--------

Check out the `template.md` file to use as the initial build.

Example
-------

You can view the `example.md` file to see how it would work for an actual project. This is something I've used when building out the front-end for Code School.
